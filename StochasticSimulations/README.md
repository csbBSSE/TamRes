This folder contains the codes required to generate the data and plots in Fig 4 and Fig S4. The topo files and the parameter set files have been give in the folder itself. The plots can be generated by running the `FigureScript.R` file. 
The simulation functions are in the `simFuncs.R` script. The plotting functions are in the `plotFuncs.R` script. Brief description for each function has been given at the begining of the function. 
The dependencies are `tidyverse`, `future.apply` (for parallalizing) and `plotly`. These codes are tested in `R 3.6.3`.
